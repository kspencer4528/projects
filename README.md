My practice projects

Light_Switch is a pysimplegui project to create a simulated light with multiple switches that turn on or off the light. The same way a light in you home works with multiple switches. I created this project to learn how to build a gui and code the logic to control the switches. The code is mid-state. It is sort of clean, but could still use some more refinement.
